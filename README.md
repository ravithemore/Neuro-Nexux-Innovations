# ðŸ§  NeuroNexus Machine Learning Internship Projects ðŸ¤–

## Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ”„

### Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using recorded, observed, and historical data. The dataset includes features such as gender, age, balance, salary, credit card holding, etc. The goal is to develop a robust model to identify potential churners.

### Models Used
1. Logistic Regression ðŸ“ˆ
2. Gradient Boosting ðŸš€
3. Random Forests ðŸŒ²

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuroNexus-Projects.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd NeuroNexus-Projects/Churn_Prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb`

### Results
Include any key findings, metrics, or visualizations from your analysis.

## Project 2: Spam or Ham Message Identification ðŸ“¬

### Overview
This project involves identifying messages as spam or ham by analyzing the excessive use of suspected words, caps-lock, exclamation, etc. The model utilizes TF-IDF vectors and Naive Bayes algorithm for effective classification.

### Models Used
1. TF-IDF Vectors ðŸ“Š
2. Naive Bayes ðŸ§ 

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuroNexus-Projects.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd NeuroNexus-Projects/Spam_Ham_Identification`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook spam_ham_identification.ipynb`

### Results
Include any key findings, metrics, or visualizations from your analysis.
